## Explanation of what each process mean

- Plan

In the planning phase, teams define the scope, requirements, and objectives of the project.
This stage involves gathering feedback from stakeholders, prioritizing tasks, and creating a roadmap for development.

* Code

Developers write code based on the requirements defined in the planning stage. They follow coding standards, practices, and guidelines established by the team. Version control systems like Git are used to manage and track changes to the codebase.

* Build

The build phase involves developing the software based on the requirements defined in the planning phase.
Developers write code, design architecture, and implement features according to the specifications.

* Test

Testing encompasses various types such as unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, and performance testing.

* Release

This stage involves coordinating the release process, including scheduling deployments, updating release notes, and communicating with stakeholders. 

* Deploy

The deployment phase involves deploying the tested and validated code to production or staging environments.
Automation tools such as continuous delivery (CD) pipelines are used to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reliability.

* Operate

In the operation phase, the software is actively monitored and managed in production environments.
Operations teams are responsible for ensuring the availability, performance, and security of the software.

* Monitor

In this stage, we monitor the performance and health of the deployed applications and infrastructure.
